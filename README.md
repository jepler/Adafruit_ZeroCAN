# Adafruit ZeroCAN

Initially, we considered creating our own library to support the CAN interface of SAM E5x microcontrollers.  This repository represents a very early iteration of that idea.  In the end, we chose to add support to Arduino-CAN--see [the Adafruit fork]( http://github.com/adafruit/arduino-can)
